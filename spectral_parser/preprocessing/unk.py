    """
    This routine returns a String that is the "signature" of the class of a
    word. For, example, it might represent whether it is a number of ends in -s. The
    strings returned by convention match the pattern UNK-.* , which is just assumed
    to not match any real word. Behavior depends on the unknownLevel (-uwm flag)
    passed in to the class. The recognized numbers are 1-5: 5 is fairly
    English-specific; 4, 3, and 2 look for various word features (digits, dashes,
    etc.) which are only vaguely English-specific; 1 uses the last two characters
    combined with a simple classification by capitalization.

    @param word
                The word to make a signature for
    @param loc
                Its position in the sentence (mainly so sentence-initial capitalized
                words can be treated differently)
    @return
                A String that is its signature (equivalence class)
